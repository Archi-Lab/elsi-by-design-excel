# Excel-based Tool for ELSI-By-Design 

This repo offers the Excel-based prototype tool I used for my thought experiment on ethical assessment & social impact analysis of a hypothethical software project. 

The sources below should help you to try it out yourself. Feel free to use the Excel as base. 

Disclaimer: This is just a prototype hack developed for a presentation, and to support my own thought process. Excel (with Basic macros) as a platform is clearly unsuitable for productive use (although it was fine for the prototype). 

I might consider implementing a "real" tool in the future, based on this concept. Therefore, I am happy to receive comments and suggestions for productification and further development.
